**General Organization of Discussion time**

**Period 1**
Nature and Use (Introduction, Chapter 1, compare Jenkins, add general comments on Clark and Humboldt) 

**Period 2**  Evidence and Method (Chapter 2 and 3) 

**Period 3**
Analysis and Causation (Chapter 4 and 5, wrap up and take away, video tutorial, Prof. Gibbs' final comments)

**Period 1 Questions:**
**(1) According to Bloch, what is the use of history?** 
Question was simply on-the-fly. Seeing we had no real build up to the list of specific oriented questions, it seemed like we should open up more broadly to get people thinking before we turn to in-depth analysis. 

**Overall student perspective: trying to understand the human element**
- Bloch has a lot of great info and concepts—and “what use is history,” would have been answered best by the chapter he didn’t write.

- He does get into the use of history, by talking about the past and the present; because that is part of history, learning who you are, what society is. 

- The rational faculty of the historian is to get order. -And lastly, history provides an avenue of entertainment. 


*Concerning “***the human element***,” and more to Bloch’s overall jive, a student quoted:*
“However, it is undeniable that a science will always seem to us somehow incomplete if it cannot, sooner or later, in one way or another, aid us to live better”(10).

- Bloch calls on scholars to do comparative studies; and to see what commonalities are there.
he’s trying to look for commonality where historians have not looked before
- and he asks if we find any universals 
- He says all fields encompass human nature, so you need to talk to people outside your profession to garner a better understanding
- According to Professor Gibbs, Bloch is trying to understand what is happening in his current moment—the war.  And he does not want it to happen again
- another student states Bloch has already been in WWI, and he is questioning why this happened again.
- how much of the process of his writing this, is him processing the fact that he was facing his own mortality?
- So, some of his book is a polemic on humanity in general, more so, scholars in general.
- Bloch is upset the world has come to another war
- Perhaps he felt the war a bit more than some other scholars because he was Jewish
- Did his Jewish experience inform part of his bottom up approach?
 -Professor Gibbs says he thinks a lot of the effort to defend history regards science, and that Bloch does not like the positivists.
- Professor Gibbs: What is it about the positivists that irk Bloch?
- Student: positivists want things to be objective, but historians have baggage
- Positivism is an epistemological position: how do we know what we know? Speaks to natural laws, hard sciences; it kind of grows out of Enlightenment and post-enlightenment 
- History gives us a deeper knowledge of “life” because it works with “the human element.” -
- Bloch is trying to deal with the worry he sees that history is going to be relegated behind the sciences, that’s why criticism is so much of his book.  He was defending his craft against people who would say, “hey, history is not a science, what’s it even worth then?”
- Student: on page 17 he mentioned sciences are moving away from hard science as well—carbon dating, you don’t get an exact date, you get a range—student: hey, that’s truth? That’s hard science?
- The whole section of historical criticism is being critical of your sources and evaluation of them -[synthesis of sources] to reconstruct a rational order, driven by a will to know and understand. 


**(2) Can we understand the Present from the Past? Agree or Disagree with Bloch. What are the limitations? How certain should we be on any topic of the Past that relates to the Present?**
Last week seemed that all students had agreed on many of the same points and we all were united in our understandings and dislikes of Jenkins. So we posed the question to be firstly: to engage the text directly: Secondly, we wanted to see if there were differences of opinion about the claim that we can understanding the Present from the Past. We wanted to see if the students saw any limitations to this concept. 

- Yes! That’s the only way Bloch sees it
- “He who would confine his thoughts to the present time will not understand the present reality” (35).
	- (57) speaks to this.
	- Agree or disagree?
	- The Past is part of being self-aware human beings
	- One cannot do history if they are not self-aware… 
- connection: Some students have observed that many who comes out of school don’t have a connection to the past. Specifically, millennials don’t want to connect to their Past.
- (p. 47), he said you can know the past or know the present, but if you don’t know one, you only know the half of it
- Professor Gibbs: to what extent is this a new problem—?  This can get at a more fundamental question: to what extent do we feel people have not connected the past to the present?  What does that stay about historians?
- James: Always. Historians have thought that, but it is getting worse.  Historians’ purpose is to connect people to the past. If we thought everyone was connected to the past, there would not be a need for historians.
- Stephanie: …this disconnect is occurring faster than before.  Our living memory is growing shorter.  Instead of having an oral history that goes back hundreds of years, it’s 20 years, or a month.
- we live in the age of Google, anything we need to know we can pull up in a matter of seconds
- Rachel: looking at this from European historians, there has always been that disconnect.  But with Native culture, there is a much bigger connection to history… but that is dropping off even there.  Native people think of the 7 directions.  And in those decisions, they led us here to this present moment, and these choices (directions) go back 7 generations. So knowing where you come from is very important for many native communities.  But often we don’t consider native people to be historians.
- Student recalled:.  She grew up at her grandparents’ dinner table, hearing those stories.  And her younger sister of ten years does not know anything, and she feels that his her own fault, not the fault of her sisters—that she did not pass that on.  - So who is to blame?  Our own generation. Living memory speeding up and it is our own fault
- Professor Gibbs on Jenkins: historians should not make truth claims. That’s dangerous. The bias and non-objectivity does not diminish the historians’ work.  

**(3) 1942 vs 2015, can we still imagine the common person wanting to relate his or her Present to the Past? This question was never asked, but was answered during the discussion.**

**(4) Did Bloch solve the science vs art debate?**  This question was never asked, but was answered during the discussion. We wanted to ask this question so that the Humboldt reading would be incorporated into the discussion. Also, the question was poised to see if the students had any likening to Bloch or Humboldt’s take on history.  

**Period 2 Questions: (5) Does Bloch believe historians can use philosophical criticism? Agree or Disagree?** We asked the below question because we had no definitive answer ourselves.  As such, we sought collaborative thought to find an answer. 
Here, because our question was not clear to ourselves, it therefore was not clear to the students.  Due to this, Professor Gibbs helped us out and directed the conversation to a comparison between Bloch and Humboldt 

- Mirella: for Humboldt, history is philosophy and philosophy is history

- Professor Gibbs: Bloch talks about the philosophy of history, but more in regards to methods.  Poetry and philosophy does not come into a lot of Bloch’s book. 

- Professor Gibbs: what are the products of history supposed to look like?  Why is Poetry so interesting to Humboldt?

- **What does Aristotle say about poetry and history?**
	- It is the universal described in terms of the particulars
	- it’s meant to be true, but not in modern standards
	- history was never meant to be universal, it was meant to be particular
	- Why is this ruler, emperor the best?  It’s particular
	- it wasn’t about empire in general, or X Y Z in general
	- so poetry is far more superior than history, according to Aristotle.
	 
- **What is the point of poetry?**
	- to make you question
	- important language concerns
	- make you feel something
- the precise nature of poetry: this particular world used in this particular way is supposed to connect X and Z; it doesn’t come from empathy and emotion, it comes more from a linguistic standpoint/word choice
- think of universal vs. the particular
- is poetry about particular moments and people—sometimes it is.
- Not about universal things?  It is the universal described in terms of the particulars
	- empathy
	
**Empathy:**
	- feels like Bloch, in his intro, says history is supposed to make you feel something
	- if everyone in history was nothing like you at all, you would not be interested
- who gets featured in history? Historical people that contemporary people can empathize with

**The Mother of All Funk Chords**

- the Irish wrote their history in poetry: rebel songs
- Poetry, whether spoken or sang, it is remembered better
- idea of narrative: history takes the form of stories

Humboldt: if it didn’t have some larger picture, it’s not useful.
There has to be accuracy, but you have to go far beyond what just actually understand that.


**In what ways to we, perhaps, need to change the production of history?  These journals, even these monographs, they are not reaching people.  If we want to better the world utilizing history we must reach an audience.**

**Who would Jenkins like more?  Bloch or Humboldt? Why is Bloch important to history?**
- History was once to support your own power—and people used history for their own power gains.  
- Bloch is diverging from more rhetorical ways of history
- wants it to be rigorous, analytical
- “What is the use of history?”  What he is really trying to tell us is “what the correct way of history is.”
- Humboldt doesn’t tell you how to do history in a good way
- and, of note, the profession has moved beyond Bloch, but Bloch is an encapsulation of the first wave of professional history 



**Period 3 Questions: (6) Should one approach History neutrally? Specific example, Bloch asks, "What do I care for a historian's belated decision on this point?" (141) When is it appropriate to Judge or Understand? Should we understand American Slavery? Or American-Indian Policy? Should we tolerate a colleague's judgement? Would Jenkins and Bloch agree on this point?** 
  When Bloch simply wanted to know who Robespierre was without all the Historians’ political squabbles. It also speaks to the politically charged writers of history that inject a judgement on an event or person(s). Moreover, there are textbooks that are not without some sort of politically motivated statements made by the author. The question was designed to engage the text, but also see how much the students felt that this was possible and if it was necessary.

**(7) Are we as graduates confident that we have adopted a nomenclature that is neutral, or have as a tool, a real sense of understanding or judgement?**
  Since this question was meant for the last period of class, we figured that much of Bloch’s, Clark’s and Humboldt’s work would have been thoroughly discussed. Therefore, this question was meant to be a self-reflection. It was meant to get us to think about any errors we have had or still possess. 

**(8) Final Question: Does Bloch give historians a way to work outside the field of history?** 
  Again, this Question was a final period question meant to be open ended and to give the students food for thought over the succeeding week and for the semester. We saw that Bloch had asked Historians to gain interdisciplinary tools like language: he also wanted outsiders to see what History was. However, we felt that Bloch didn’t encourage Historians to go beyond their element and project History in other careers. We wanted to see if the students felt the same and if they were or will be confident to go beyond the profession of Historian.

**Preparation quotes and ideas:** 

According to Bloch, if a Historian finds a piece of evidence (of the past), does this evidence speak for itself?
  So what or how, then, would block argue on the issue of subjectivity?
(Long Bloch quote [puny] to use as evidence:)

>To neglect to organize rationally what comes to us as raw material is in the long run only to deny time—hence, history     itself For can we understand this or that period of Latin if we detach it from the earlier development of the language? This form of ownership, or those beliefs were not, of course, absolute beginnings. Inasmuch as their development proceeds from the most   ancient to the most recent times, human phenomena are governed primarily by chains of similar phenomena. To classify them according to kind is to lay bare the principal effective lines of force.

I would argue Bloch would say evidence does not speak for itself, because if it did you would be putting your “baggage” of the present onto this historical piece of evidence.  Bloch argues the historian must be, more or less, a master of the time, place, and therefore context from which the evidence derives.  So the question is, is this subjectivity?  Is subjectivity inherent in this?  Or is this just “being a historian?” What is, then, “being a historian?” Obviously I just kind of went down my own rabbit hole.

What is Bloch’s take on empathy?
- Below relates the above science versus art (question 4) debate to the questions of present and past:

- “There is, then, just one science of men in time. It requires us to join the study of the dead and of the living. What shall we call it? I have already explained why the ancient name, 'history,' seemed to me the best. It is the most comprehensive, the least exclusive, the most electric with stirring reminders of a more than age-old endeavor. In proposing to extend history right down to the present (contrary to certain prejudices which are not so old as history itself), I have no desire to expand the claims of my own profession.”

- On page 144 Bloch writes, “How much easier it is to write for or against Luther than to fathom his soul” (141).  **What do you think this quote means?  What is it to “fathom his soul”?  Is this a call for empathy?**m

- **He argues for the historian to be up front about your faults, which again speaks to accepting and admitting existence of subjectivity.**  “It will never be amiss to begin with an acknowledgment of our faults” (29).

- **The Cross Examination** “dictates are etched into his brain by the convictions and inhibitions fanner experiences, by means of tradition and by means of common sense, which is too often to say by means of vulgar prejudices” (65)

- **Argues location, time, context (again like Jenkins):** “In a word, a historical phenomenon can never be understood apart from its moment in time” (35).

- **He is big on comparison, and causality:** “…there is no true understanding without a certain. range of comparison;” (42).

- “Like any scholar, like any mind which perceives at all, the historian selects and sorts. In short, he analyzes. And, to begin with, he seeks out the similarities in order to compare them” (144).

- “the use of the causal relationship as a tool of historical knowledge indisputably demands a conscious critical treatment” (190).
 
 - **He is big on the present moment:**  “…the student of the present is scarcely any better off than the historian of the past” (50).


- **He is not arguing to throw rules or guidelines out the window** 
“Every historical book worthy of the name ought to include a chapter, or if one prefers, a series of paragraphs inserted at turning points in the development, which might almost be entitled: ‘How can I know what I am about to say?’ I am persuaded that even the lay reader would experience an actual intellectual pleasure in examining these ‘confessions’” (71)

**On common sense** 
“Above and beyond the peculiarities of individuals of every age, there are states of mind which were formerly common, yet which appear peculiar to us because we no longer share them” (80).

**Everything counts as evidence** 
“Above all, a fraud is, in its way, a piece of evidence” (93).
