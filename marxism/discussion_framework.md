*By Aleja Allen and Taylor Perk*

*Below is the framework we had sketched out for the class and the points people had raised.*

1) Why the inclusion of the chapter on structuralism?
  *	Does language have an impact on the tradition of Marxism? "…examine the ways cultural meaning emerges in various historical texts: sermon, advertisements, folklore, popular ritual." i.e. think of propaganda in the WWII Lears pg. 589
  *	Does the post-modern world inform something - if anything - significant about the role Marxism will continue to play? Iggers Pg. 13
    *	Language: I don't know
    *	Split out of the linguistic turn
    *	Different take of history - competing lenses of thought
    *	Marxism may be the only one that hinges on language - terminology
    *	History written without the subject in it - the big problems
    *	Clark pg. 43 came up
    *	Marxism and structuralism have big ideas within themselves
    *	Way to look at reality - it’s a structure, explains the individual actins 
    *	Have we seen this idea of structuralism before? - Bloch
	    * Human element, nature - understand human nature through the larger things - what people did in a larger system
    *	Structure represents a collective action
    *	It's more big picture
    *	Bloch, or other historians use history?
      *	B talked about a lot of little things
	    * Behaviors in the society - religious, social, language, dress
    *	Have to look at all the records of a time in order to fine the big issues - we can't continue just tell a story
    *	Spontaneous society - why have people adopted things they did
    *	Structuralism was perceived as anti-history because of its opposition to humanism/subject
 
2) Value judgments of authors in relation to Marxism
  *	Perhaps important to remember: Marx more then likely didn't mean his theories to involve brutal and cruel dictators
 
2.5) The cultural turn: failure of state socialism or suppression of Marxists or both?
  *	Iggers pg. 10, is Marxism reaching a point of being outdated? Should class struggle be looked at in a new way, since the   middle class encompasses such a broader part of society?
  *	OR: should Marxism be redefined in post-modern society and be reapplied? Iggers pg14
 
3) Base vs. Superstructure (Iggers/Lears)
  *	Should the historian consider the possibility that the "base" is in part responsible for the "superstructure" controlling it? Lears pg. 571-3. Would Jenkins or Bloch agree with this view? Why or why not?
  *	The historical bloc: is this a thing of emaciation or a way for the dominant to remain in power because they use it to their advantage? However, is this an instance that the bloc is able to influence the dominant in order to suit its needs? Leads to concessions. Lears pg. 71.
    *	Historical bloc notion: uniting a community by economics is important, but now we have broader lines that we connect with   Lears 71
    *	The dominated might not want to be free - there are a lot of groups but even then some might not want to be in that group
    *	Bottom up history doesn't work as well? Aren't to be likely to make those social changes
    *	Structure and superstructure don’t work against each other
    *	Someone who goes against the grain, their giving it more recognition, and if you don't like it, then make a new one
    *	The base influences the superstructure and it's an ever influencing cycle, it's symbiotic 
    *	You have to connect Marx to all the other parts of history
    *	It can be applied outside of the haves and have-nots
    *	What use is all this theory for historians? What do we do with it?
 
4) Empiricism and Marxist economic analysis: do they work together, why or why not?
  *	Shouldn't data fit well with Marxist? Or does it - Marxism - lack too much of the human element? Iggers pg. 12
 
5) Cultural hegemony: why are the old ideas no longer in use - covered
  *	(Thompson) Is the dominant culture now too powerful for the working class to successively overthrow? Why would it have been different "pre-industrial"?
 
5.5) Working class "experience" as a memory/history
  *	How does it shape the cultural hegemony? Lears pg. 577
  *	Does the memory work for or against them? There really haven't been the violent overturns that Marx expected so do the working class, and those revolutions have been more, "…[rooted] in local tradition undermined by industrialization" Lears pg. 582
 
6) Contemporary views projecting backwards: rational choice economics and Thompson "experience"
 
7) Marxism as science: in what was is it/not?
  *	Will be discussed again with the Annales School
  *	Does it function better on paper, allowing the historian to make more informed inquiries about history?
 
8) How do we use the things we read for today to apply to our practice?
  *	The class struggle permeates a lot of histories - subaltern studies
  *	It can be interpreted wrong - it can be too simplistic, are you being an “accidental Marxist”
